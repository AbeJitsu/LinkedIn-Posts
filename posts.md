## LinkedIn Post - January 27, 2026 (TO POST)

The creator of Claude Code said something that stopped me mid-scroll:

"100% of my coding is now done with Claude Code."

Not 50%. Not "for the boring stuff." All of it.

Here's what caught my attention:

He runs multiple Claude instances simultaneously - some in the terminal, some in the cloud. He starts projects on his phone with Claude Code on iOS while he's away from his desk.

The result? Claude Cowork was built in about two weeks.

This isn't about AI replacing developers. It's about coding becoming location-independent.

The old model: You need your laptop, your IDE, your setup.
The new model: You have an idea at dinner, you start building on your phone, you refine it on your laptop later.

What changes when you can code from anywhere:
→ Ideas don't have to wait
→ Progress happens in the gaps (commute, waiting room, lunch break)
→ You become the manager of AI agents, not just the person typing

Five years as an Army medic taught me that the best tools are the ones that work wherever you are. A stethoscope in a clinic. A tourniquet in a field. Now, a coding partner in your pocket.

The developers who figure out how to manage multiple AI instances effectively? They're going to build things the rest of us can't keep up with.

How are you thinking about AI changing where and how you work?

## Facebook Post - January 27, 2026 (TO POST)

My job has completely changed in the last year.

I used to spend hours typing code line by line. Now I spend most of my time explaining what I want built, reviewing what comes back, and steering the direction.

It's like I went from being the person with the hammer to being the person who designs the house.

I still need to know how everything works - you can't direct something you don't understand. But instead of doing one thing at a time, I can have multiple projects moving forward at once.

Yesterday I started an idea on my phone during my lunch break. Picked it back up on my laptop that night. Something that would've taken me a full weekend last year took a few hours spread across the day.

This is what AI actually looks like for most people who use it for real work. Not robots taking jobs. Just regular people getting more done with the same amount of time.

Still feels a little surreal honestly.

Has AI changed how you work yet? Or are you still on the fence about it?

  Most small business owners didn't start their company to wrestle with technology.

  You started it because you’re great at what you do.

  But somewhere along the way, you realized you also need a website that doesn’t embarrass you, systems that don’t eat up your evenings, and maybe some of that AI stuff everyone keeps talking about.

  That’s why we launched[needthisdone.com](http://needthisdone.com/).

  We handle three things:

  Websites — Custom builds that actually represent your business. No templates, no “figure it out yourself” DIY platforms.

  Automation — That repetitive task you keep doing manually? Let’s make it run itself.

  AI Services — Not chatbots or party tricks. Real AI tools that handle real business work.

  The process is simple: you tell us what you need, we give you a clear quote, we build it while keeping you in the loop, and you launch with confidence.

  No complicated tech talk. No surprise invoices. Just technology that works as hard as you do.

  If you’ve been putting off “the tech stuff,” let’s talk. Free 30-minute strategy call, no pressure.

  Panic is expensive. In the Army, "triage" wasn't a buzzword. It was a method for making hard decisions when you didn't have enough time or resources.

  You assess quickly. You prioritize ruthlessly. You act.

  I see a lot of development teams treat every bug like a catastrophe. They sprint in every direction, burn out, and often break more things in the process.
  I take a different approach.

  When a production server goes down or a critical bug appears, my pulse doesn't go up. My training kicks in.

  Assess: What is actually broken? (Not what feels broken).
  Stabilize: Stop the bleeding. Revert the commit. Isolate the traffic.
  Treat: Fix the root cause.

  You can teach someone React syntax in a bootcamp. You can't teach them how to keep a clear head when the database locks up on Black Friday.

  I bring calm to the chaos.

  Most founders don't need a full-time developer. They need someone to get the thing built so they can get back to running their business.

  Here's what I've seen work for early-stage startups:

  Website: Start simple. A clear landing page that explains what you do beats a fancy site that confuses people. Get online, start collecting emails, iterate.

  Automation: That task you do manually every day? The one that takes 20 minutes but feels like an hour? Automate it. Connect your tools. Reclaim your time.

  AI agents: Not chatbots. Actual agents that handle customer inquiries, process documents, or research competitors while you sleep.

  The pattern I keep seeing: founders spend months trying to DIY their tech, then finally hire help and wonder why they waited.

  If you've got a project stuck in "I'll figure it out later" limbo, let's talk. Free quote, no obligation.

  You've probably wondered if AI can actually do real work without you watching it. I ran an experiment: five AI assistants working on the same codebase simultaneously.

  Each handled a different task, running at the same time.

  The interesting part wasn't the speed. It was what broke. They kept stepping on each other's work because they didn't know the others existed. So I built a simple system: each assistant tracks only its own changes.

  Now they work in parallel without conflicts. The lesson? AI works best when you design the boundaries, not micromanage the work.

  What constraints have you found helpful when working with AI?

  Been thinking about why I built[needthisdone.com](http://needthisdone.com/). Honestly? I just want to be the person you can count on. You know that friend who actually follows through? The one you can hand something to and just stop worrying about it? That's what I'm going for.

  Whatever you need done with your website, your content, your online stuff. I figure it out. I get it done. No drama. I built the whole platform myself to prove I could actually deliver. Shopping cart, checkout, user accounts. It's live and working right now.

  Five years as an Army medic. Seven years at Toyota. Both taught me the same thing: show up, follow through, treat people right. That's really it.

  Yesterday I talked about what users experience. Today: what makes that possible.

  Before anything goes live, I test it. Obsessively. Every click. Every form. Every "what if someone does this weird thing?" scenario. Not because I enjoy it — because I've seen what happens when software breaks at the wrong moment. Frustrated customers. Lost sales. Apologetic emails nobody wants to send. I'd rather find problems before anyone else does.

  Why do I work this way? Five years as an Army medic taught me that winging it isn't an option when it matters. Seven years at Toyota taught me that the person across the table deserves your best — even when they'll never know the effort behind it. Now I build software with that same mindset.

  The goal is simple: you shouldn't have to think about whether it works. It just does.

  Most websites are held together with duct tape and prayers.

  I wanted to build something different.

  You click "add to cart" and it responds instantly.
  You check out and the payment goes through securely.
  A confirmation lands in your inbox moments later.

  No glitches. No confusion. Just smooth.

  That's what I've been building lately: a professional services platform from the ground up.

  What does "from the ground up" actually mean?

  → A shopping experience that feels effortless, backed by real payment processing
  → User accounts that remember you (Google or email sign-in, history always there)
  → Automated emails that arrive at exactly the right moment
  → An AI assistant ready to help 24/7
  → Mobile experience as solid as desktop

  Then there's the invisible work:

  Quality checks catching problems before anyone notices.
  Accessibility built in so it works for everyone.
  Security woven into the foundation, not patched on later.

  This is the kind of work that energizes me.

  Building things that solve real problems. Sweating the details so the people using it don't have to.

  I've been thinking about what makes a good developer.

  It's not just writing code that works.

  It's writing code that still makes sense six months later when someone needs to change it.

  It's explaining technical stuff in a way that actually makes sense to everyone.

  It's building things that don't break when real people use them.

  Here's what I bring:
  Systems that handle real traffic and real payments
  Code that catches problems before your customers see them
  Clear communication - no confusion, no runaround

  My path here was different - Army medic, then car sales, now full-stack development.

  That's exactly why I get it: you need someone who understands the technical work AND why it matters to your business.

  Looking for my next role. If your team needs someone reliable who won't leave you guessing, I'd love to chat.

  What's one thing you wish more developers understood?

  You probably have a dozen technical problems that aren't getting solved because your team is stretched thin.

  I specialize in being the person who takes those problems off your plate.

  Here's what I do well:

  • Build production e-commerce platforms (checkout flows, payment processing, order management)

  • Automate manual workflows that waste your team's time

  • Integrate AI features that actually add value (RAG systems, semantic search, chatbots)

  • Write tests so bugs get caught before customers see them

  • Communicate in plain language — no jargon walls

  Recent work:

  Complete e-commerce platform with AI chatbot, appointment booking, and admin dashboards.

  137 automated tests.

  Handles real traffic, processes real payments, runs in production without constant firefighting.

  What makes me different:

  I've built systems that handle real traffic and real payments — not just portfolio pieces.

  My background (Army paramedic → Toyota Finance Manager → Full-stack developer) means I understand both the technical work and the business reasons behind it.

  If you're tired of developers who over-promise and under-deliver, let's talk.

  I'd rather show you what I've built than tell you what I can do.
